## Event Feedback
- There was 150 people that attended
- Helen did a great job organizing and coordinating the events
- There were lots of no shows
  In the future send a reminder to those registered 
    about attending and letting organizers know if they can't attend
  Advertise / have walkin spaces available
- Good table/ tech setup
  Ensure projecter setup and t-shirts arrive
- There was wide range of skills
- There was great mentoring opportunities
- Good Food

## Harvesting Improvements Brainstormed
- There were questionable pipeline entries (i.e. Ann Arbor)
- There should be a Data wiki available in the  pipeline staging section 
  Assist other people harvesting 
  by letting them see what has been staged
- Data should be available in staging for other pipeline users
- Identify people with certain skills
  Contact them ahead of time and prime them to help others
  
  
## Thoughts on uuids overlaps
- Overlap in urls, but unique uuids
  maybe a page per url or other format
  some possible "Base Set"
- We should have workshops on tools


## Nest Steps 
- Next Event is March 24, at Northeastern University
- Debrief with NEU
- Develop a Cookbook / Wiki / Diagnostic Manual
  How to run a battery of tests / scripts in a set / run by a metascript as a framework
  How to scrap nested sites
  How to scrap a map
- Develop workshop for the event on how to use tools
  10-15 minutes at event and led by a volunteer
- Reaserch urls so that they are ready for harvesting at the next event
